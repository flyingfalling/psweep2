//REV: what var?
//std::string setvar(const functsig& fs);

//Whoa, sometimes it needs to return something? I.e. a string? Oh shit, it always does...?
//std::string getvar(const functsig& fs);




//REV: make it also implicitly take a "variable context" or something, so we know which variable set to draw from?
//I.e. take it from "current workspace", or, specify a hierarchical level to take it from? By parsing the variable? I.e. variable name info contains
//the required info? That is a really ugly way to do it? But how else? Will it always read from blah? Nah, might refer to something set/used by user?
//What happens when we set a local variable? Do we want to be able to set remote variables too?
//In the end, everything modifies variables? What's the point of this, it's just playing with setting/reading. It's not actually doing anything.
//The whole point was to make it easier to construct things...and to do stuff like read fitness etc... But some vars have given usages in terms of
//e.g. the search function's variables, on what to read? Setting "required" files to start, etc., that is useful I guess. At any rate, I need to be
//able to read/set variables. Question is, do I allow myself to do it in parallel or not? I.e. how much hierarchical variable sets to do we have?
//All sets above me are visible (of course). Without any reference. but I need a way to refer to variables of certain models specifically? I.e. there
//is a global guy, but what? Where am "I" though? I.e. at time of reading, how do I determine which "set" I'm in? User can set vars e.g. at command
//line or something... Or in that set? How about if I'm not in a pset? Can I have variables outside of it? Ah, yea, what if I'm not in a pset? Do they
//stay for the whole time? Hmmmmmm yea, I guess so... like, global. What if I want to include multiple files? Append them all I guess. Being inside
//"scope". Man scope is a pain in the butt... Just make a temporary variable set, set those values, etc.. Propogate all higher-order guys I guess...

//Refer to previous set guys, etc. I.e. a variable, but it refers to a specific blah? Refer to a previous VARIABLE SET? I.e. the variable set of
//previous worker or pset or blah, and #10. How to refer to different "models" then. User can refer to models I guess. And then when doing variables,
//refer to model as well? Or just have a "global" one too, to make it messy haha. How to refer to it? Use e.g. :: notation? Or, force functions to look
//into e.g. VAR(MODELNAME, VARNAME). Easiest to implement since I don't have to descend into string. I.e. NAME variable sets in other word. How do I
//refer to it if it is too deep though? E.g. what if I want to refer to a previous variable in a workerset type thing? Search all models for name. Or
//just have global model space. Better/easiest to have no "hierarchy". Do I want to be able to specify sub-models? Nah, just give arbitrary names I guess.
//Question is, to find a model that is nested, I need to do multiple e.g. A::B::thing...annoying. So, only allow 1 level of depth? Or tell it which
//variable sets to "use"? I.e. which to "bring in". Hm ok. How about stuff like hm? Yea, I want to be able to read from previous guys at the worst case.
//Give functions for that I guess. And when I set in cmd, just set models, and some other vars, that script will read online. I.e. "modelparams" type shit.
//Like SWEEP:NGEN, and stuff? Want to set user stuff. Ah, it's directly set there though. And in normal C code for that model, user reads that stuff
//anyway, OK. Ah, but it must be named some special way, i.e. user knows it is in SWEEP:BLAH, not just BLAH variable. OK...fine. So, no hierarchy, but
//rather something like "include", which includes all models by default? And when I want to refer to something? I refer to it above? How about psets,
//inside a parameter point? Can I refer to other parameter points? E.g. Nth pset, blahth variable? Special variables? Like, working dir? Mostly for
//required files. Like "output" of previous. Define some functions?

//So, a global variable set, or just one that's inside this thing. Easiest that way, if they can all communicate. Have functions to search globally. And
//also have functions to search more locally? Fine. At any rate, have "tag" for each variable set, and just have a global one? Some may not have
//tags...fine. What is "no-tag". What about ones for each like, one for each guy. What is it a number or something? Make a local one and set stuff
//in there, and then scope disappears. What about global one for the file or something? Nasty...We need to keep those alla round of course. But,
//named in which way? Do I really want to keep one around for each parameter point, forever? I Have no need to really communicate between paramter
//points right? OK, in which case um, have local inside parameter points? Ah, each parameter point also has its own thing. And it is automatically
//set up into a list of "PSETS", and within those, ordinal numbers. OK, and those are accessed in those way. And then, there is general models too.


//So:
//GENERAL (no name)
//NAMED (i.e. model name etc.)
//PARAM POINT / PARAM SET (ordinal in order) / WORKER SET ORDINAL (thread #)

//They have some "pre-defined variables", e.g. for directory, etc. And then there are required files. I set those, adn those define the
//things that other guys require for actually running work. I can set them from cmd line locally, or from config files, etc. Many ways...ghetto.
//Need a "nicer" parser, but whatever, I can do errors and stuff later.

//User always determines how to parse a variable.

//Can variables be arrays? This is a major question. What will I use an array for? To generate a list of numbers for example. A list of files. OK.
//that'S right. E.g. for example if I want to interact with that list, I will make a guy to generate a string from it. But the variable itself is not
//that, it is literally just an array of strings. And then to actually use that I need to apply the function to it and the -b or -v or whatever?

//Should I literally make it nested, or just have connections? I.e. how to tell that it is a hierarcy. Easiest to just have "children" and "parents"
//Where children is a list of that sort. For searching, no need to do that, sort by name or something though I guess. How about having two lists? The
//NAMED/GENERAL one as one, and the PARAM POINT one as another.

//That's fine. OK, so nested, or connections? Easiest to just have a list, one for each param point. Of the current step? And each one is passed that
//parampoint as it. Just a list of parampoint varlists, and they are organized/searchable in some way? They are cleared after each? After they are used.
//Mmmm, so a (doubly) linked list or something. For easy removal after the end of their period. Cycle through them? Just have a list/new one made at
//each time point? A way to access them in some "specific" way? I need to pass a pointer to one for each "parameter point" search function thing, so it
//knows to search only in that one? And they all already search in the "named" section. ok. What knows to search? First, we search in a single var list
//for a name/value. Then, we can use a way to do that multiple times in a larger function. Ok.

//And we have nested variable lists...fine. We can literally add it to the structures?
