//REV: header file for searcher, which provides various search functions
//User will call one of these, passing the appropriate inputs,
//and it will automatically construct everything and run the sweep I guess....

#include <filesender.h>


//takes user options and runs corresponding search funct?

//"Format" is required...for each different search, what kind of info it needs to parameterize it. I guess just parameterize it with a global varlist.
//REV: OK how to parameterize it with some global varlist?
//Do like PARAMNAME, PARAMMIN, PARAMMAX? How to name it? In individual varlists?
//Use varlists NAMES to find it, inside what? A hierarchical? No...just use a varlist structure... I.e. named list of varlists...Ugh.
//This seems "best", but then user needs to be careful to construct his scripts/etc. as max/min/etc. Or give a better way to read varlists,
//like VAL MIN MAX STEP etc.? So, basically ways of taking 2-d values? Need to take "column" headers, etc. Need it for simulation anyway (read mii-sans
//data?). OK, I guess I can do this. So, now we have some kind of 2d var list structure, where we tell it the variable (row#?) and the column name
// (e.g. var name vs val vs etc.?)
//Effectively we have a 2-column thing now. Make it even more general? We want to eventually have more "abstract" i.e. jagged ones, as we talked about
//before...i.e. nested information.
//I.e. varlists are arbitrary? but then how do we hold arrays? In varlist, it's just an arbitrary list until some endthing? How do I know where it
//ends in read-in? That is the problem?
//Need a way to have arbitrary length array stored somewhere? Only up to 3D array? Either 1D of array type (i.e. all guys are arrays), or 2D of single
//value types...? Need a way to arbitrarily "flatten" matrices of arbitrary length. Ways of storing in memory. Of course, we can but reading/writing
//will not be compressed/efficient. If it includes strings, that will make it only more complex.
//But in the eventuality that I want to run experiments/store it on NSIM side, need a way to do it, right? I don't want to have to repeat every single
//variable every single time. E.g., better to have a way to compress it uniquely. But representation will change if I change number of guys.
//E.g.

//We can rearrange this in some way to make it "hierarchical" based on most efficient graph/tree search... i.e. might be more efficient to "list" it
//by timepoints (var4) if there are more (fewer?) of those. But then how to arbitrarily do it without actually listing out every single one, e.g.
//tell it what each "location" is and then store it that way. I.e. don't write "neuron#" or "time point" each time., just do it? HDF5 might be the
//most elegant way of doing this? But how do I go through and analyse that? E.g. electrode # etc. Doing e.g. EL1 and EL2, or some arbitrary number of
//electrodes (and their positions). How to list those out then? Like, how to specify "experiment" to do most efficiently?
//I.e. TIMING, LOCATION, STRENGTH of each stimulation or something like that. Need a way to parameterize that in an N dimensional space. Timing of
//each is a dimension? Similar to eye movement/visual stimulation analysis. Too many dimensions, and not clear how to orient them to make it most
//informative. Like, I want to basically "list" parameters in some hierarhical way, and finally have e.g. TIMEPOINT and NEURONNUMBER known without
//listing them. Need a "organization" file (how to interpret data file), and then "data file" itself. Same file is obviously best. HDF5?
//Anyway, in this case, do named varlists obviously, easiest. Wasteful. Want to have 2d table things to read too though. Use HDF5...exists, and
//efficient. PRoblem is that stored information might have arbitrary lengths (i.e. strings), or might be doubles or whatever. But to process what
//user is doing, he will make it via some CMD program? Some GUI?
