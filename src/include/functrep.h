//What is the goal here? The goal is to build a representation so that I can actually execute each simple function representation, i.e.
//it takes the statement and converts it to a variable. Up until now it was as std::string.
//It also looks up the first tag thing as the function name and gets the function.
//For the second, it executes the function. For most functions, it is just a variable get (i.e. VARNAME()). If it has arguments, it executes it
//as a functrep to get the variable out? Note, that will only be for SETVAR things, where I am setting it of course ;)
//It will ALWAYS only be SETVAR anyway! So have two possible settings? At any rate, it builds a function...that has the argument as a variable
//OR as a statement? If they're separate...I need to choose appropriate representation for each.

//Note we start with effectively a list of STMNT. We can first extract the guys to arguments of statements. And then those can all be done
//in one go? Except SETVAR. Have a branch there to make things easier heh.
//Or just use one struct but include a possibly "unused" branch for setvar in case it is a more complex statement than a variable read.


//make recursive...at only one level? I could actually make this more recursive...oh crap...instead of unrolling the statements, I could just make this
//recursive? In which case it needs a "list" of functreps? Ugh. Has some desired # of arguments. Ugh...




//Uhoh, I'm confused. Eventually, we want just a string. But for arguments we want to leave variables?
//We execute each in turn, which may have side effects such as setting variables etc.
//Remember eventual goal is to "run" this script for each time/each pitem, but variables may be changed. And, this may do things like set
//some variables (locally), read other variables, etc.
//In the end, we set CMD? Or do we set a variable that appends many guys together.
//Crap, LEAF_STMNT can have zero arguments. In which case, it's either a variable read (function), OR it's a literal. We could differentiate based
//on a starter special character (e.g. $).
