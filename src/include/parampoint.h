  //check/rewrite OUTPUT file list from SOURCE mydir to NEW mydir
  //check/rewrite INPUT file (name) from SOURCE mydir to NEW mydir
  //check/rewrite MYDIR from SOURCE to NEW

  //Read out OUTPUT files (don't bother copying back?)

//1) We will have a farm funct that calls a parampoint generator to compute the results for a given parameter point. Passed as a single varlist ?
//2) This requires having the (specific) parampoint (variables) set properly. It also requires the SCRIPT for how to generate each
//   param point.
//3) This is decomposed into the individual PSETS () and PITEMS (). It checks required files etc. and resolves variables at that point.
//   We only execute the PITEMS at execution time
//4) We finally generate the CMD string (variable), which is executed at the end of the script (?)

//We construct a parampoint generator which has the set of named vars (the global ones), as well as the (list of) param point vars for each param point.
//Those are (constructed by the) made by the script. OK, start out with root which has the specific ones passed to me...
