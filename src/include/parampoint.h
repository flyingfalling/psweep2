  // and we can't specify it, it will error out -- so we will check to make sure it is forced to be in user dir). We copy these back.
  //3) OUTPUT file list (these must be inside MYDIR or else error, so I will rename them). We copy these back (and read out?)
  //4) INPUT file (name) just a single one (rename this and specify, inside MYDIR).
  //5) MYDIR string (just a single one) -- will modify to user.
  //6) MYCMD, a vector of strings, will be concat with some "SEP" at the end. Find all of the above changed guys, stringmatch, and change to new updated
  //      guys. Note, change to some canonical form first, to handle stuff like ../blah versus /local/blah, etc. I.e. use PWD, etc. Do that later.

  //SLAVE receives REQ files one at a time, and writes to arbitrary filename (MASTER side does the PRE/POST conversion? No, do it on SLAVE side and store
  //  remember the PRE/POST names)
  //NOW MASTER is done (just waits for finished)
  //Now on SLAVE side:
  //check/rewrite SUCCESS files from SOURCE mydir to NEW mydir
  //check/rewrite OUTPUT file list from SOURCE mydir to NEW mydir
  //check/rewrite INPUT file (name) from SOURCE mydir to NEW mydir
  //check/rewrite MYDIR from SOURCE to NEW
  //for all MYCMD, match SOURCE of any of the above, and switch to NEW.

  //Execute the CMD. REDO, until it is done. If error, return some MESG that indicates what happend (i.e. failed to run, didn't have success files,
  //etc. These return to MASTER and cause error at MASTER

  //Check SUCCESS files existence.
  //Read out OUTPUT files (don't bother copying back?)
  //I could copy back SUCCESS files if I want to (do it later?)
  //SLAVE says "we're done!", MASTER receives.
  //SLAVE sends OUTPUT. Master recieves OUTPUT varlist.
  //SLAVE sends # FILES (and correspondences?), then sends one file at a time.

//3) This is decomposed into the individual PSETS () and PITEMS (). It checks required files etc. and resolves variables at that point.
//   We only execute the PITEMS at execution time
//4) We finally generate the CMD string (variable), which is executed at the end of the script (?)

//We construct a parampoint generator which has the set of named vars (the global ones), as well as the (list of) param point vars for each param point.
//Those are (constructed by the) made by the script. OK, start out with root which has the specific ones passed to me...

//ANY message, I think that is possible.


//What is executed in main thread? There is some main search algo, that we call, i.e. we construct a search funct. And we simply iterate
//it until it is "done" But the search function also constructs (by itself) a parampoint_generator for handling vls at a time. The user
//passes that separately. I.e. he makes a parampoint_generator by himself




//Parampoint generator -- generates an actual parampoint (psets etc.) based on originally passed SCRIPT, and also varlist containing PARAMPOINT
//to evaluate.
//Only generates when called. Keeps track of parampoints as well, i.e. history. Keeps track of which have been "farmed", which are "ready", and
//which are "done". Note each parampoint struct keeps track of this in addition to other information. That is bad, should separate that out? Meh.

//Furthermore, there is a search function that gets outputs from finished parampoints, generates new ones, etc.. I.e. that is the controlling runner.
//It gets a pointer to parampoint_gen and passes guys to it to get out things to run. Finally, when it is finished, it somehow gets out the
//results and does something with them.

//Is the search function at all related to how I actually farm out the guys? No, has to do with workers. Set a "max farmed at a time" type variable,
//so it writes that many parampoints to file as it goes. Much easier that way no obvious "generations" or something.

//Every generation could be a file (?). Easier to have one large file... in which case we need to handle errorful writing? We can correct it...erase
//most recent generation? Or do checking of success.

//What does the SEARCH function do? It has state I assume, may require responses before continuing, or not?
//It generates a bunch of guys at the same time, computes them, gets results, writes to disk, etc., until we decide it's done.

//OK, this is "at a time" value that was selected. However there may be "stops" e.g. if not enough to get a generation. So we don't know what
//it uses to generate the next set of guys. But we know it must be passed a VL as a result. It has its own unknown method for generating.
//Base class, and make it a higher level class. I really don't want to use a pointer or some shit like that?

//Takes generic hierarch varlist that handles things?





//REV: HOW TO DO THIS.


//User builds the search function (specifies params, which function to use etc. In some main proram).
//User also specifies the method for building the param points by giving the script. Specifies #workers etc.
//The search function generates varlists for parampoints, and gets results back. That is all it cares about.
//It knows nothing else.

//Separate than that, we have something that executes parameter points. It goes through a list of parameter points to execute, and does them.
//The list is a LOCAL list (not the full list) of only "this turns" param points.
//So, we build a mini param point generator, and pass that as a chunk, get the results all back.
//Inside this mini list, we will be distributing to workers.

//I guess this is the point at which we write out to HDF5 or at least write out regularly, because e.g. if it is a SWEEP then there will be no
//"generations", and thus no stopping points (because it might be inefficient).

//This works best. Then, we might have a global list of all the param points after.












    //REV: we now have the actual parampoint, we need to/want to execute it now.
    //Also, parampoint_vars has the hierarchical varlist pushed back.
    //We need to actually EXECUTE it in order, doing the CHECKS and running CMD with SYSTEM, getting RESULTS, etc.
    //Note, as of now this just generates parampoints, but it also makes the required dirs etc. We need to literally
    //have the "signal" to each to execute the CMD. But, we need to "get" the cmd. Note, will each worker independently handle itself? Yea,
    //it can all do it itself. We can pass the pitem to the worker, and it will handle everything ;) Otherwise, local /tmp won't work or something.
    //So, serialize it etc. So, the local worker needs to do execution when passed the CMD (in fact the thing itself. FUCK PARAMPOINT CREATION MUST
    //BE DONE BY THE WORKER LOCALLY, or file stuff might be messed up. I.e. construction must be done there. That is not good. I.e. the actuall).

    //REV: why do this here? If we will write it out of course. Problem is of course what? Ah, PSET must be made locally. But we can make/do everything
    //for workers, then copy it to the correct location. That is how it SHOULD work. We ASSUME there is a network drive (lustre etc.) of some kind.
    //Why am I using this and not HADOOP like thing? At any rate, workers give the thing the targets to write to locally (i.e. place to execute from?)
    //I assume we move everything to the RAMDISK. And then copy it only after it is done. I guess that works. Same worker is not guaranteed to do
    //every pset of the guy we need, so in between we need to copy back to the shared file system (and/or have some way to communicate to targets the
    //stuff they need). If we communicate via file system it works with LUSTRE, but it will not work if the file-systems are totally separate.
    //If the file-systems are separate, we have a problem. So it's best to make a shared file-system. But, we could do it over networking too. In other
    //words, move everything via network from all the workers to the "master's" system after it is finished. Question is whether this is worth it or
    //should we give "afinity" to a single box for all pitems? Of course, but meh. How long will copying of results take? Could take a while. But, it
    //is on DISK, so we need to READ FROM DISK, and SEND TO MASTER. Figure this out later...for now we are using shared file system as a hack.
    //To send it back over MPI, it is a bit of a pain in the ass. Because the "master" needs to receive it. Can we have the "master" spinning? Ugh.
    //Should we only send "output" files, or EVERYTHING the user's program completes? Note, of course SUCCESS files are needed. And they are same as
    //next's REQUIRED files.

    //Option --USE FS (accessible from all workers), or

    //Best option: Workers have a "scratch" space, they "know" to automatically copy everything to /tmp (or not), do their work, then copy back.
    //Furthermore, every worker (when created) has all the files he needs created. Note, user specifies "required" files, he can specify "data: X" to
    //tell to get it directly from DATA location, rather than typical copied location. That way it is success file.
    
    //How about normal files? They "require" from worker, but heck they'll all be copied. Make everything with a "worker-base" which can be modified.
    //In other words, um, all file paths are modified to be from worker base. At worker spin-off time I guess. I.e. the "overall" guy is already created,
    //then everything is copied and executed by worker.

    //PROBLEM:
    //In CMD, we need to construct at WORKER time!!!!! Which is the real problem, because we may need to specify to USER PROGRAM via CMD that
    // it should use FILE X FILE Y etc., which are IN /TMP or something, not the original locations in shared network drive.
    //So, although we get relative file locations from user, and it creates them in shared space, at actual execution time (CMD construction time?)
    //we modify the corresponding file paths to refer relatively to worker /tmp base.

    //How to do this? When a WORKER gets a PSET, it gets the raw unadultered one? All file references (required files) are COPIED (OK...fine?)
    //and all data files are already existing (likewise?). At /tmp locally. Problem is, we need to modify the REFERENCES in the script (specifically
    //in CMD) so that they refer to proper TMP locations. And this needs to be done BEFORE cmd is generated, i.e. before EXE happens.
    //Creation of dirs output of files might take time, so why not just delegate it to workers themselves. I.e. send the parampoint to the worker,
    //and have it do the required creation? Nah, pain in the butt. But, creation of the PITEM is good. Problem is e.g. there might be "required
    //input" from previous PSETS, thus we can't just copy the worker dir. One major problem is that multiple previous PSET PITEM might have overlapping
    //filenames!!!! E.g. if they are all named equivalently "output". Maintaining a copy of everything on each machine is out of the question I assume.
    //However, we can maintain local FILE SYSTEM reference locations? So, recall things like PREVIOUS_PSET( outputfile ) must appropriately resolve
    //AT RUNTIME to point to local TMP locations, where they were copied or something (i.e. dirs must be set). So, after all, we will create a whole
    //DUMMY directory sturcture of each PARAMPOINT at each WORKER, but will only FILL as necessary. How do we coalesce? Well, we "writeback" only the
    //CURRENT (this PITEM) directory to the global. I like that. So, all directory references must be constructed/generated online with respect
    //to PARAMPOINT-HEAD (or "DATAHEAD"), which in case of /TMP system will be temporarily reset to /TMP absolute file location BEFORE generation of
    //CMD (i.e. of that PITEM). However, it must be done globally first, so that all PITEMS write out their appropriate files in the first place? No,
    //that is not necessary. Just go one by one, creating and running. When we pass to a worker, we already are checking REQUIRED/SUCCESS files,
    //from the "already run" pitem creation, and we copy those accordingly to the corresponding /TMP file locations (automatically, if they exist).
    //Then, we RECONSTRUCT the PITEM at the target location (we don't bother creating the dir right??? We just need to change file locations in
    //variables/strings. That is the problem. Best to have them all "constructed" from a source at runtime to generate the CMD. We don't generate
    //CMD until the very end, after we may have changed "base" to appropriately reflect everything. I like that idea.

    //Still minor problem of how to copy/create all the "old" guys from previous PSETS at the /TMP location...
    //Also recall that we have some "minor" problems in that some functions can have other side effects, such as creation of things, running
    //programs etc.? So, require user to have a "setup" that specifies required/blah files before a "run" cmd? I.e. creation of the CMD variable.
    //Nono, all stuff to set CMD is set...shit. This doesn't work. User's thing will actually create teh CMD anyway ugh. So, yea, we need to
    //re-run it again, but this time, with all success files etc. locally, so that CMD resolves correctly.
    //If the script has side effects or something, that is a minor problem, as we will be running it twice...
    //Shit, it will be adding variables etc., that is the problem!
    
    //So, we will just execute the "set_CMD" command one more time at the very end, but now the passed varlist will have "basedir" set to something else.
    //Note everything is strings or shit, so it has no idea that the STRINGS are FILE PATHS. So that is just nasty, because we don't know when user
    //may set a string var to a file path and then use it later without calling the correct "function" to get it in a locally valid manner.
    //Let user make all file references in some way that is safe, i.e. give a function that pads the string at beginning with the base dir.
    //OK, and then hope user uses that if he knows what he is doing ;) Like PREFIX_BASE_DIR( blah ). of this pitem, or a previous psets Nth pitem, or
    //whatever. Note that an array of variables needs to be done in that way too..? For reading arrays of previous guys, ugh. So, we will SKIP all
    //SET_VARS? No, that won't work. At the end, our only option is to run the user script, get the REQUIRED/SUCCESS variables copied. Then,
    //we will NOT automatically parse everything to fix the paths... but we DO need to re-run everything to re-generate from scratch.
    //AH WE CAN DO THIS JUST CLEAR OUT THE HIER VARLIST AND START FROM SCRATCH. But now with everything set to /TMP. OKOKOKOKKOKOKOK. GO.
    //This assumes EVERYTHING IN VARLIST WAS CREATED BY THIS SCRIPT, i.e. there is nothing else in the varlist.
    //But we might be getting varlist stuff from elsewhere (e.g. named etc.?). Nah, disallow that.
    
    
    //So, todo is to make sure that user specifies files all as happening globally. E.g. required files and success files etc. Those are all COPIED
    //to a given location, and then file paths are set to those new locations I assume. Problem is of course before CMD generation, which may reference
    //those. Even if it's global, we still need to SEND to worker on different computer. Have that all happen at start (copying data files).
    //But that's a problem as we have to generate them? Nah...but its "required" for a given guy. I.e. specify "data" files. Don't recopy every time?
    //Assume that um, individual workers will have blah? Ah, for each worker. Based on script? Ugh. Make user specify everything in there?

    //At any rate, send it all over a port? Or MPI setting? I guess I can serialize it all as binary and send over MPI ports, then write to file
    //just like that. Seems a waste to send over MPI though..? But is there any other way? SSH or SCP or some shit? Either way it will go over network,
    //and be written/read to file. Specify the "data folder", and just leave it there or something? "Generate" name lists?

    //So, this is part of the "actually executing". First, I run it, and do all the copying etc. to the worker who has "hit" it. Passing the parampoint.
    //Build the structure at the worker's /TMP location. The worker has its "base directory" in some way, just like other guy. But all guys are copied
    //with relative path to TMP, e.g. in data files etc. If there are name clashes, we have a problem? E.g. multiple global dirs with sub-dirs with
    //overlapping names etc.? That is a pain in the ass. If there is a clash, I will re-name it. But user program might not know I changed it, it might
    //assume a certain filename? E.g. if I pass a "data dir" but not individual data file names or something? Hopefully user doesn't do that. Don't do it
    //unless you will use it policy! Forget it for now, but it can be resolved heh.

    //So, at initial position, when calling, we send the varlist along with it so it knows. But, on THIS side, we do the "sends" of all the guys to the
    //selected worker. Who is "waiting" for it. Gets the stuff, writes it.

    //At the same time I have changed the names of all the files to be different/local. I.e. for each file I have send/copied (based on var), I have
    //changed the name to some arbitrary local one at the target location. They may start in some diverse locations though... so I need a way to
    //copy them? Just name them arbitrary things? Assume user program does not expect some named file or else. Meh, depending on loc? We can give
    //it new local name too or something? For each? But then we must pass it to CMD.

    //Offer function that has underlying impl. It may be MPI, etc. We don't know. Hadoop? OK, we can do that later (DFS?)
    //Workers sit and wait.
    
    //Hadoop?
    



//We have the parampoint_gen constructed. We need to build (another?) one of these locally, in other words this is passed in memory (ugh).
//Should only pass the necessary things....no need to pass previous param points etc.? Passing contents of vectors etc. pain the but wow...
//Anyway, so I pass the constructor thing along with the filenames etc. So, first all the required files are sent with their new names and locations,
//and this side worker writes them to TMP or whatever.
//Note settings might be different per workstation? Ugh. Infiniband??? Ethernet speed times two at most... But disk write speed will be holdup.
//How long will it take to transfer what, 10 kb of data? At 10 Mbps that is already um, 10 ms, but 10 mbs, so 1/10 of that, i.e. 1 ms. Assuming we have
//6 K80s, with 2 each in them wow. That is 12 GPUs. So, with 12 GPU, we can be amazing. We could even run multiple on each (if we can). If I use same
//spawning worker, I could theoretically run multiple kernels on same GPU. But only if it is actually only executed from the same GUEST program!!!!
//I.e. the C++ simulation. So, that has to be executed from in the same thread even (!!!!!??). I.e. in concurrent. Ugh.

//Note, host program has to access GPUs automatically. Meh. Host # etc., they need to communicate which GPU is open! Pain in the butt I guess. And
//data about the GPUs. So I can get CUDA info into main program and use it to feed them stuff. Based on estimated size etc? But I don't know about that?
//Can I Know which are "open" and which not from CUDA probing?

//Either way I need to send it to the workers. So I have a worker, it signals its ready. I select it, I send it. The other side is waiting to receive
//some format?
//Just send as bytes I guess. Or ints. Or whatever. Must be bytes. Source and dest machine must match up I guess? Sending INT etc. Must send as chunks
//because file size might be very large (larger than INT_MAX). Make sure file write is not blocking? Have 2 threads or something...?
//

//Worker spins and executes only when got stuff. Same as other, send "ready" to master. Just as before, but now I send so much more. Send "new" filename

//dynamically load a function (model), pass data that way?

//User needs to include the header file of his lib to have it compute properly.

//I.e. force user to have his header etc. included, and then compile with .so included? No, can be after.
//Or force user to compile with???

//All nasty, still we're hitting LDAP too much or something. Is there a way to get current process to "switch" its identity? I.e. same thread runs,
//but we "override it" multiple times? Or we could spawn new one each time or something... We'd like to load everything at start time.

//I just realized I may be thinking of this backwards. Another highly likely way to do this is to create as a LIB, the sweep program, and then include
//that (as C++ include or shared lib) into my main C++ model thing. And then, each "rank" is just one of my main model things running.
//So, I include it, and then I in each thread, start the libs worker thing, which spins and waits? And when it gets it I simply call my own model code
//with the stuff from the main guy. Problem is that e.g. user must generate his own main function? Nah, just pass the function signature or something?
//At any rate, we are passing everything back as memory, which solves a big problem. This may be best/necessary for cuda implementation. Note that each
//worker can then execute SYSTEM call for non-C++ guys and communicate with files in that way. That is the best idea? It keeps C++ main while allowing
//other guys to happen. Problem is that user must modify his own code to use the library, and write the script I guess. Specify SYSTEM commands versus
//some other way of scripting things without modifying the user program main stuff. E.g. constructing CMD for other guys. For direct C++ guys, we need
//to specify what memory to pass to it? We know some things like variables, so we can just pass those directly. Force user to use the variables, but
//that's fine. We can pass them by name haha.


//At any rate, need to figure out how to communicate required files or whatever to target, as correct variable names (filenames)
