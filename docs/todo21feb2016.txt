REV: Make it so global names can be passed into config scripts

REV: Make it so that we can do Mii san time series

REV: Make it so NSIM will work from memory.

REV: Make it so that means are done by another C++ funct (will need to refer to "last generation" guys...see if it works ;D ).

REV: Make it run on GPU for mad speed. Need to sample available GPUs and use those. Note if stuff is done before GPU we can do it on CPU while worker
     is waiting for GPU...wow that will be hard to code in current paradigm.

### REV: Make hdf5 not do the open/close thing for datasets. Reduce string reads/rights, optimize searches of large vectors for strings...
