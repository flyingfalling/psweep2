Make it so that backups etc. are based on average generation (?) time, instead of number of guys.

Make it so that user can select his own fitness/distance function, e.g. number of data points that are satisfying limits of acceptability?

Allow user to also give a "scale" (or "weight") for every data point, which is not just the size of epsilon, but also um, the multiplier for adding to "number
meeting acceptability criteria"?

Implement MT-DREAM-z or something? Just to try. User needs to choose the "likelihood function". Not, also allow user to e.g. train some more complex functions,
such as the GLM being trained on the individual variables, like Vrugt etc. were doing.
