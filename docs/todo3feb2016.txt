1) Make it so that hierarchical prints only one from each if same in each level.

2) How to handle passing of PARAMS to user program (without passing other variables e.g. MYDIR)
--Named variables
--MAIN named varlist
--Only pass root-most?
--diff names for parampoint and pset dirs not __MY_DIR.

3) Call from memory, i.e. let C program call it. User registers funct, but
   now it passes all files and keeps them in memory. User program has to
   be able to handle those. Can I redirect stuff to memory?

4) More efficient way to do it, only read input files (like data etc.?) once.

5) Make a safe EXIT available to all things that call MPI_Finalize etc. and destruct all FILESENDER.
   Also, for interrupts, catch them properly and hit all threads? I don't have any in this case so OK.

6) Make search function work with old search guy other than grid. Normalize way of passing variables to global NAMEDVARIABLES or something?

7) Make it write to HDF5 etc.
