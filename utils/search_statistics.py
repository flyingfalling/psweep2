#REV: python which opens the HDF5 file, reads out "accuracy" for each diagnostic variable for each chain (not proposals, but values?).
#REV: e.g. for a neuron we are fitting Vrest, Rin, Vthresh. We want to see how those evolve.

#REV: Also, plot a distribution for each model over the last N generations, for each chain. Could run a PCA etc.
#REV: within chain? Or between chains?
