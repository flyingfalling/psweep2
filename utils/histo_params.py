#REV: neuron uses NANOAMPERES.

#REV: Assuming that andreas used PICO, I need to multiply 20 by 1e-3. So, instead of 20, it should be 0.2? 20.0 -> 2.0 -> 0.2 -> 0.02


#REV: python which opens the HDF5 file, reads out "accuracy" for each diagnostic variable for each chain (not proposals, but values?).
#REV: e.g. for a neuron we are fitting Vrest, Rin, Vthresh. We want to see how those evolve.

#REV: Also, plot a distribution for each model over the last N generations, for each chain. Could run a PCA etc.
#REV: within chain? Or between chains?

#REV: print chain, gen, newval. Otherwise, they all stay at old value :0
#REV: do the same thing for X? Nah we already have Xval I guess...
#REV: make same plot for each separate variable, different colors for different chains.
#REV: I can then go and "access" the value at that point, fine.

#REV: now I can build the model performance matrices.
#REV: note, at some point, I need to actually save the model "run" values, to show what happened. Need a way to save it in the HDF5 file itself?
#REV: or I could re-run it? Use same random seeds? Impossible...
